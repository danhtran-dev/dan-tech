As a Software Guy, I understand the feeling of spending a lot of time seated in front of a computer screen. However, one day I discovered running and it completely changed my life! Running has become my escape from the daily grind of being at my desk. It's a chance to be outside and breathe in fresh air, feel the wind on my face, and move my body. The boost of energy I get from running helps me feel prepared to tackle whatever the day brings and keep up the great work!

Running is not only a great way to stay physically fit, but it can also help maintain emotional health. Sticking to a running routine has taught me that with discipline and effort, I can achieve anything I set my mind to. Just last week, I completed a 59km Ultra Trail Marathon, which was an unforgettable experience. Throughout the race, I was tested both physically and mentally, facing steep inclines and rocky terrain, walking through the forest at night under the moon, and enduring the pain in my legs for the last 20km. However, the sense of accomplishment I felt when I crossed the finish line made it all worth it! 

Running has taught me the importance of self-care, allowing me to show up as my best self at work and in life.

If you're feeling stressed or overwhelmed, I suggest you put on your shoes and go for a run. It might help improve your life.

Remember, get better every day!
