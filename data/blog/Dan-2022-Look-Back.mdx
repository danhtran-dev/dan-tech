During 2021 all of us were in a very bad situation.

I mean we can't go out, can't meet new people, can't travel or even can't breath...
2021 woke me up after 6 years of coding as a person who code for food.

I asked myself about the meaning of coding, meaning of what I'm doing with my life, How and Why people around treat me so bad, and ... I realized it's not about What they do for me or What I do for them, It's all about What I do for me.

Then, I decided to make changes!

I changed my living apartment.

I changed my job.

I changed my life style.

I changed how I code.

I changed how I learn.

I changed how I communicate and influence other people.

I changed every thing except me. I'm still Danh-myself, but a better version.

Thank you my Friends who still be here, looking at my move, respecting and supporting me on all my steps.

Thank you my Family, 100% supporting me from behind without any complaints.

Thank you my Love, 101% believe in me, believe in our future. I love you.

Wish a better 2023!
